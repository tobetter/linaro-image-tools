linaro-image-tools (0.4.1) natty; urgency=low

  * Brown paperbag release.
  * Sort files in commands ran by linaro_media_create.rootfs.move_contents()
    as this breaks the testsuite on some filesystems.
  * Disable pkgbinarymangler when running the testsuite as it might cause some
    stderr output which confuses it.
  * Uppercase Python in python-linaro-media-create long description.
  * Drop util-linux from Depends as it's Essential.
  * Update Build-Deps for testsuite requirements (qemu-kvm for qemu-img,
    u-boot | uboot-mkimage for mkimage and command-not-found for
    CommandNotFound) and recommend command-not-found to locate the package of
    missing commands.

linaro-image-tools (0.4) natty; urgency=low

  IMPORTANT: this version of linaro-image-tools breaks support for 10.05
  images; we hope to restore this support really soon but it was more
  important to release this update and have support for linaro-n images.
 
  * New major release
    - Large parts rewritten in Python (Michael Hudson, Guilherme Salgado,
      James Westby, Martin Ohlsson).
    - Various bug fixes.
    - Notify users that apt-get will be run in target rootfs (Martin Ohlsson);
      LP: #651906
    - Use fdisk -l for output rather than sfdisk -l (Martin Ohlsson);
      LP: #673410.
    - Allow passing multiple --hwpack when creating an image (Michael Hudson).
    - Add --hwpack-force-yes to linaro-media-create to forcibly install
      unauthenticated packages (Michael Hudson).
    - hwpack-create now has a --debug option (James Westby).
    - hwpack creation now outputs a manifest external to the hwpack as well
      (Michael Hudson).
    - Add ability to add local .debs to the hwpack with --local-deb
      (Michael Hudson).
    - Update dependencies; new deps on python-testtools, python-parted,
      python-dbus and more, drop obsolete deps.
  * Fix support of space in pathnames (Paul Larson).
  * Update Depends to cope with mkimage moving from uboot-mkimage to
    u-boot-tools.
  * Fix empty Vcs-Bzr.
  * Strict >= ${source:Version} dependency on python-hwpack.
  * Use python2 dh sequence instead of python-support; add a python >=
    2.6.5-1~ build-dep.
  * Uppercase Python in description (lintian).
  * Various cleanups.
  * Drop omapfb.debug=y from kernel cmdlines as DSS2 is stable nowadays.

linaro-image-tools (0.3) maverick-proposed; urgency=low

  [ Steve Langasek ]
  * no longer using the 'omap' uboot flavor support in live-helper; instead,
    run the mkimage commands directly for omap.
  * fix the paths used for looking up x-loader and u-boot binaries in the
    tarball; these don't belong in /boot at all, pull them from /usr/lib.
  * only enforce the presence of commands we're actually using; this lets
    us automatically pull in btrfs-tools when btrfs is specified.
  * add sudo to a couple more commands in linaro-media-create, so the script
    itself can run as non-root as intended.

  [ James Westby ]
  * Add a linaro-hwpack-create script for the creation of hardware packs.

  [ Steve Langasek ]
  * Fix lookup of linaro-hwpack-install to work correctly when l-m-c is on
    the path.  Closes: #652669.

  [ Loïc Minier ]
  * Drop spurious single quote character in boot_args_options for beagle|igep;
    thanks Peter Maydell; LP: #667400.
  * Set LC_ALL=C when entering the chroot as it has no locales.  LP: #651905.

  [ Tom Gall ]
  * Use --numeric-owner argument to tar when unpacking, so that files get
    the right owner on boot of the image.  LP: #652121.

  [ Dave Martin ]
  * Implement proper cleanup handling on signal / exit, so that we don't
    leave clutter behind on error.  This also fixes the message at the end of
    a successful install about being unable to unmount proc.  LP: #616385,
    #660196, #667394, #643601, #627383.

linaro-image-tools (0.2) maverick; urgency=low

  [ James Westby ]
  * Add a module that provides some improvements to tarfile.
  * Add some matchers for testing the content of tarfiles.
  * Add the skeleton code to create empty hardware packs.

  [ Torez Smith ]
  * Add IGEP support; LP: #627611.

  [ Loïc Minier ]
  * Fix deps in control as well: depend on uuid-runtime rather than
    uuidgen-runtime and do not depend on util-linux, e2fsprogs and coreutils
    as these are Essential: yes; thanks Colin Watson.
